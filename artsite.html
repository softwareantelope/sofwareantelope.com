I have an idea for you.  Market your own line of products in the USA/EU using drop shipping.  Why is this a good idea for an artist and how do you do it?  
If I had a dollar for everytime someone replied to my suggestions by saying "I am not technical" - but this is not a technology but an interaction with a partnership of mutual interests.  I am just running it by you to see what you thought.
You make rather interesting designs in your paintings - if you can get high-quality printable images of these and knowhow: you can print and sell a range of brandable products in the USA/EU.  I can set up the software and if you have a good product and learn to promote it right via your social networks, the market could be grown into something more extensive.  
I have set up such a site and am thinking of setting up a NZ based business that arranges shop sites for artists in a profit-sharing partnership that can return 25% for canvas prints, 20% for hats and tote bags, 15% for mugs and 10% for teeshirts. (these margins are flexible and need to be to find a sweet spot where promoting the line works.
Something like that.  If you like the idea as a way of working, then I will design a package that my NZ business can manage which can be administered.  The site would be run by my company (costs are covered) and the site development would follow one of two recognised standards in e-commerce.  The artist would grant a copyright licence for being able to resell products with online accounting of sales and costs with a 50% share of profits.
